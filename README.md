## ✨ Vibe Coding Features in Action

### 🎯 **Context-Aware Intelligence**
```typescript
// You type:
"Add user authentication"

// AI understands your project and suggests:
// - Uses your existing JWT service pattern
// - Follows your middleware structure  
// - Maintains your error handling approach
// - Updates relevant documentation automatically
```

### 🔄 **Continuous Learning**
```typescript
// After working together:
AI learns your preferences:
✓ Prefers async/await over promises
✓ Uses specific naming conventions
✓ Follows your testing patterns
✓ Understands your architecture decisions
```

### ⚡ **Instant Project Understanding**
```typescript
// No more explaining:
"What's my current database schema?"
"How is authentication handled?"
"Where should I add this new feature?"

// AI already knows from project analysis
```

### 🌐 **Global Team Support**
```typescript
// Team in Seoul
developer.setLocale('ko-KR');
// Gets Korean documentation and suggestions

// Team in São Paulo  
developer.setLocale('pt-BR');
// Gets Portuguese context and help
```
